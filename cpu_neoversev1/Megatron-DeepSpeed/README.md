# Megatron-DeepSpeed Container

Creating a new Megatron-DeepSpeed container based on the PyTorch version 2.5.0 container.

## What is Megatron-DeepSpeed?

### Overview
Megatron-DeepSpeed is a framework optimized for training ultra-large transformer models. It integrates the model parallelism technology of Megatron-LM with DeepSpeed's distributed optimization features, enabling efficient training of models with billions to trillions of parameters.

### Features
#### 1. Megatron-LM  
A large-scale transformer model training framework developed by NVIDIA.
- Supports model parallelism (Tensor Parallelism, Pipeline Parallelism), enabling efficient training of models with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters.
- Utilizes high-speed custom CUDA kernels.

#### 2. DeepSpeed  
A large-scale distributed learning framework developed by Microsoft.
- Reduces memory usage with ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer), allowing larger models to be trained on a single GPU.
- Provides features such as CPU offloading, communication optimization, and mixed precision training (FP16, BF16).

### Key Benefits of Megatron-DeepSpeed
#### 1. Integration of Model Parallelism (MP) and Data Parallelism (DP)  
Combines Megatron's Tensor Parallelism & Pipeline Parallelism with DeepSpeed's ZeRO for efficient training of ultra-large models.

#### 2. Improved Memory Efficiency  
DeepSpeed's ZeRO-3 distributes memory usage for parameters, gradients, and optimizers.

#### 3. Large-Scale Cluster Support  
Optimized for multi-node distributed training using InfiniBand / NVLink.

#### 4. Mixed Precision & Low-Precision Training  
Leverages FP16, BF16, and 8-bit quantization (DeepSpeed-AIO) to reduce computation costs.

#### 5. Dynamic Batch Size Adjustment  
Supports ZeRO-infinity, which dynamically adjusts the batch size based on available memory.

### Use Cases
- Training large language models such as GPT-3, LLaMA, and BLOOM.
- Distributed training of ultra-large transformer models.
- Maximizing computational resource utilization for AI model development.

## Creating the Container

### Base Model
The container will use a locally available image created with the PyTorch version 2.5.0 definition file published in this repository.

### Installing Python Libraries
Using the `pip` command, install necessary libraries for large language model training and inference, including:
- `transformers`
- `deepspeed`
- `trl` (reinforcement learning library)
- `peft` (fine-tuning library)

### Installing Megatron-DeepSpeed
Download from Microsoft's repository and build the helper libraries.

## Usage Examples

To be added.
